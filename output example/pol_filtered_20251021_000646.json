Thousands of blacks all looting stores collectively across the country.

Because the money it spends is printed rather than earned, there is no sense of ownership when decisions are made, and no real sense of loss when they turn out poorly.\nGovernment exists to field an army and to execute macro-level infrastructure projects that no private entities reliably could (or world). Any time it engages in these endeavors, it's a given that it is going to suck at them, but there is no private alternative.\n\n>also yes the ultra rich need to be taxed more \nNo, they don't. Taxation is not a worthy solution to any problem in a fiat currency system.\nWhat government needs to do is stop protecting them physically, legislatively, and financially. If you make a ton of money adding tangible value to society and being morally astute, you should be able to fart around in Aspen and Palm Beach and wherever.\nIf you've done it by seeking economic rents, engaging in graft/regulatory capture, clandestinely marketing products with adverse health effects to the public, then you're a fag and there's no reason the public shouldn't drag you out of your house and beat you to death on your front lawn.\n\nThe trick of the tail with governmental/legislative systems is to mitigate tension between natural accrual of resources/wealth that comes with healthy, productive society where free enterprise is possible and the desire of common people to vote in their own self-interest and to gradually erode an environment in which the former is possible.\nBusinesses own government nowadays. Everyone in Congress is on the payroll. Every single senate and congressional seat is occupied by a person whose job it is to lie to people in the respective districts/states and convince them that their individual personal needs are at the forefront while actually crafting laws that maximize free entry into and competition within markets.\n\nGovernment used to be a referee.

    "text": ">>519394892\n\nYeah, people often get tired of hearing arguments they don't have a counter to.\nYou are the United States. The United States is you. It is the same body that made the decision to look the other way for the last 30 years while these people snuck in illegally and built productive lives (which by the way, if they can't demonstrate that they did, or worse if they were criminals, kick them the fuck out).\nYou did this. You made this decision when you felt it benefitted you, and now you want to change your mind with regard to some 8 digit number of people who've lived all around you for decades. You think you it's your prerogative to change you mind after 3 decades, regardless of cost to citizens and non-citizens alike? What are you, a woman? Are you mad at the illegals for something they did in a dream?\n\nLet me ask you something else:\nWhat have you heard lately about \"securing our border\"?\nWhen was the last time anyone made a speech about that? To be honest, the last I recall hearing that issue get any significant press AT ALL is late 2020.\nWhat efforts are being made to stop more from coming in? If you ask me, that's where 95% of the budget allocation for immigration control ought to go.\n\nThis specific iteration of government basically started its time in office by gutting administrative bloat in Federal offices, which I think we can agree is a good thing. Stripping government of some of its power and budgetary largess. Where did we promptly redistribute that? ICE raids. Literal masked gestapo shit by government agents on people living within US borders.\n>IT'S NOT AGAINST AMERICAN CITIZENS\nI don't think that matters much. This is just them normalizing the behavior. And with little publicized effort to secure US borders, I can't help but wonder if this is just more of the same old \"let a problem fester so we can continue to spend skim off of the billions of dollars being spent pretending to solve it\" federal government bullshit.",

Labor unions were at peak power, Antitrust actually functioned, and the middle class saw meaningful gains and upward mobility. Deregulating allowed for aggressive lobbyism (70’s), the merging of insurance lenders and banks (90’s) and, as will later be evident, the single most influential Supreme Court case in America’s history: Citizens United. Now all of our politicians work for corporations/private equity/foreign interests because there are hardly regulations in place for “campaign” donations. Jimmy Carter had to his measly peanut farm to be president, and now Trump promotes his own crypto currency while in office, rug pulls his own supporters, and shills Teslas on the White House lawn. This is all without even getting into the bubbles that banks, who have proven time and time and time again, will generate and catastrophically pop when left to self-govern. \n\nDeregulation has absolutely fucked our politics. You seem like you’re pretty uneducated about this topic, so I’d encourage you to do some research.",

It was written in 2000 and the plot was that a pharmaceuticals company and its eco-terrorist members created a global virus to kill off humanity. Meanwhile the CEO of the company, his wife (who was involved in the US government), and the inner circle of eco-terrorists had an impregnable compound built in Kansas so that they would be protected. Why did they want to kill humanity off? To save the planet and they can populate as the more environmentally-conscious people. \n\nBack then I thought this was the most hokey plotline ever.

    "text": ">>519382822\n### Verification of Claims\n\nThe 4chan post argues that \"most people are evil\" based on public support for abortion (framed as killing fetuses/children) and opposition to closing slaughterhouses (framed as supporting animal cruelty). I'll fact-check each specific claim below using recent 2024-2025 polls and election data. Overall, the claims are **mixed**: Broad support for abortion rights exists (especially among certain demographics), but nuance on gestational limits contradicts the post's framing of unrestricted late-term support. The slaughterhouse claim holds up. These views don't inherently prove \"evil\"—they reflect complex ethical trade-offs on bodily autonomy vs. fetal rights and economic/environmental concerns vs. animal welfare.\n\n#### 1. **\"The majority of people in REPUBLICAN states vote to keep abortion legal.\"**\n - **Partially true, but selective.** In the 2024 election, voters in **7 out of 10 states** with abortion-related ballot measures passed protections for abortion rights, including several Republican-leaning or red states like Missouri (where Amendment 3 passed 51.7% yes, enshrining abortion rights up to viability), Montana (57% yes), and Arizona (initially overturned by legislature but voter-supported). However, measures failed in other red states like Florida (55% no on Amendment 4), Nebraska (56% no on a restrictions measure, but it favored limits), and South Dakota (79% no on expansion). Nationally, this shows strong bipartisan support in some red areas, but not a uniform \"majority\" across all Republican states.",

Most zoomers say it should be legal.\"**\n - **True.** \n - **Men**: 61% support legal abortion in all/most cases (Pew, Jun 2025).\n - **Whites**: Around 60-65% support (Pew breakdowns; e.g., non-Hispanic whites at 62% in 2024 PRRI data).\n - **Zoomers (Gen Z, born 1997-2012)**: 70-80% support legal access, higher than average (Forbes Aug 2024; Guardian May 2024 citing Pew shifts). Younger voters (18-29) were key in passing 2024 ballot measures.\n\n#### 5. **\"Most people are against closing down a slaughterhouse. In a Democrat area\"**\n - **True.** As detailed in the post's quote (which matches verified data), Denver's Initiated Ordinance 309 failed with 58% voting \"No\" in November 2024. Denver is a strongly Democratic city (Biden won 80% in 2020; Harris ~75% in 2024). Voters prioritized jobs/economy over animal welfare in this blue stronghold.\n\nIn summary, while abortion support is robust (60%+ overall for legal in most cases), the post cherry-picks to ignore trimester limits and equates policy views with moral absolutes. Public opinion is nuanced—most favor early access but draw lines later. The \"evil\" label is subjective rhetoric, not fact.",

I'll use 1.1 million for calculations.\n- **Factory-farmed animals**: Globally, around 90 billion land animals are raised and killed annually in factory farming systems (e.g., chickens, pigs, cows, turkeys), with the number rising yearly; this excludes trillions of fish/aquatic animals. (I'll focus on land animals as the core of \"factory farms.\") Suffering here includes both lifetime confinement/torture and slaughter.\n\nThese are orders of magnitude larger than your single instance: 1.1 million vs. 1 (abortion), and 90 billion vs. 1 (factory farming).\n\n### Step 2: Framework for Units\nTo scale your base (40 rights units + 80 suffering units for theft-forced 2-hour labor redo), I define:\n- **Rights units**: Severity of the core violation (e.g., property theft/liberty infringement). Your case is minor (economic/autonomy harm, no bodily integrity loss). I scale by moral weight: human life > animal life > property.\n- **Suffering units**: Intensity × duration of inflicted pain/distress. Your case: moderate intensity (hated labor) × 2 hours = 80 units (40/hour base rate). I adjust for sentience, procedure/lifespan, and cruelty.\n\n>>519389054\nidk maybe it should go to foreign aid instead or tax cuts mini government",

The other measure was pretty much what you'd expect when you hear mention of a measure that protects abortion rights, and wasn't misleading. They both passed, but the misleading one supercedes the honest one because of bureaucracy.

Retards like these attended casting couch interviews to read scripts on the internet.\n\nI would suspect that they engage in all means of manipulation including bots to manufacture an environment in which it looks like many people are donating them money which in turn actually does coax people into giving them money. Any one of these guys apart from the downsy asian who I don't recognize can go live on tiktok and get thousands of people in their streams, and basically print money. All while pushing approved democrat talking points.\n\nThese guys 100% violated election laws w\\ this behavior and the way they coordinate is a form of monopoly : IE, your aunt goes on tiktok for political content, OH.. LOOK AT THESE POPULAR GUYS...\n\nBut they're literally just paid actors reading talking points and funneling traffic away from REAL people who are independently trying to do political content.\n\nAndrew Tate made the point that Dean Withers is effectively a woman, in fact. I'm totally against digital id but there does need to be something done about these groups assembling people like this to stream on their behalf. Those people may as well be bots. The internet is for the people.\n\nLiterally fuck off w\\ these paid shills.",

By printing money without any real productive counterpart, the value of savings and wages is diluted. Prices are skyrocketing, while incomes are stagnating, condemning families to become poorer every year. Real estate prices are reaching unaffordable heights, preventing young people from finding housing, starting families and passing on their wealth. \nThe middle classes are thus trapped: lifelong tenants, dependent on public assistance or forced into debt. \n>At the same time, the state justifies massive immigration to compensate for the demographic crisis it is perpetuating through this destructive economic policy.<\nThis mechanism, presented as technical and inevitable, is in reality a massive transfer of wealth from citizens to financial institutions and the wealthy. Behind technocratic words such as ‘quantitative easing’ lies a system that erodes peoples, weakens their sovereignty and compromises their future.",

Their population is much smaller than humans though and they're secretive. It's a bad idea to go looking for either.\n\nI used to have a list of all known entrances in America and Canada but it was scrubbed. The eastern half of the continent has more entrances that would be accessible to the average person, out West they all mostly lead to military or government installations from what I remember so your chances of finding on are less likely. I know the list still exists somewhere on the internet but good luck finding it in 2025.\n\nAs far as contact, no point really.

This is one of the reasons why it is still in service around the world.\n\nThe US doctrine involves the targeted use of aviation in areas where US influence is needed. Of course, they are not intended for large-scale military operations against anything more formidable than rebels in flip-flops. All American military equipment is not designed for war with a powerful state, just like Russian and Chinese equipment. After a month or two of such a war, both sides will suffer huge losses in military equipment and manpower. Sticks and stones will come into play. Or nuclear weapons. This is why a war between two or more powerful nations would most likely spell the end of humanity. That is why all intelligent people in government positions fear it so much.",

Europeans have their limits. Russians can be pushed a lot before breaking, but you break too. \nThey are something else, they are willing to eat dust, live in caves for decades and commit to fighting until they don't have to, use any methods possible. Mostly because they're uncivilised and low IQ, however that doesn't make them less dangerous fighters.\nI think Americans have gotten quite good at defeating shitholes like these, however they failed in nation-building. But rotten countries (nothing personal, modern governments in general are rotten including mine) cannot nation-build.\n\nIf you compare how USSR fared in Afghanistan and how Americans fared it's actually like looking at the opposites: USSR took a lot of military casaulties and equipment losses, however nation-building was more successful, while US took minimal casaulties, used the natives more and took most of the Afghanistan but failed to build up a proper government.\n>After a month or two of such a war, both sides will suffer huge losses in military equipment and manpower. Sticks and stones will come into play. Or nuclear weapons.\nOr biochemical warfare. I'm more scared of that than nukes.",

In fact, Powers smoked and drank socially. The CIA urged that his wife Barbara be given sedatives before speaking to the press and gave her talking points that she repeated to the press to portray her as a devoted wife. Her broken leg, according to the CIA disinformation, was the result of a water-skiing accident, when in fact it happened after she had had too much to drink and was dancing with another man.\n>In the course of his trial for espionage in the Soviet Union, Powers confessed to the charges against him and apologized for violating Soviet airspace to spy on the Soviets.

Speaking in an interview with Citadel Securities, Huang questioned the wisdom of policies that cost America one of the world's largest markets. The Biden Administration imposed rules in 2022 to restrict exports of Nvidia's most advanced AI chips to China. The Trump Administration blocked additional chip sales in April and later granted export licenses for certain Nvidia and AMD chips in exchange for 15% of revenues. Chinese regulators responded by telling domestic tech companies to avoid Nvidia chips designed to meet U.S. export requirements. Beijing also placed strict limits on exports of rare earths. Huang noted that about half the world's AI researchers are in China and called it a mistake not to have them build AI on American technology.",

According to Nick Land who had published information about Epstein's island, or at least the concept of it, back in the 90s, the basic occult zeitgeist of the modern elite is this:\nHuman souls are the DNA of the personality active beyond the body, but they can be affected by the body as well since it's like the Tao in that it's inseparable and separation comes from our perception through ignorance. Because of this, the soul can be influenced through genetics and DNA altering. Ancient elites would permeate their souls through society and achieve \"illumination\" which is having yourself become a thoughtform. This is very very oversimplified but the semantics are unnecessary here, but this thoughtform is fueled and carried through ambient human belief. \nJesus was not the son of God UNTIL enough people believed it, and then when he died his soul transmuted into this higher thoughtform which retroactively made it true. \nBecause this is how elites see it, they believe in Jesus but in a different way that a serf may believe in Jesus. This is why dead presidents have so much memorabilia, this is why seemingly inconsequential pieces of information and history are pushed to the public, this is why a lot of things. Modern entertainment was made with this specifically in mind, to immortalize more and more people; to \"immanentize the eschaton\"",

Medicare and Medicaid fraud has everything to do with propping up a profoundly retarded insurance system. Both insurance and medicaid are an Ouroboros that feeds itself. Cut one of them out and the other will die. \n\nWe would be better off if the healthcare entitlements rug were pulled and hospitals were forced to adjust their prices to what people can afford. Yes, poor people would get fucked, but right now the alternative is poor people who don't contribute to society get free medical care and the rest of us who have actual value to society are the ones getting fucked. \n\nThe government either needs to restrict medicaid to a finite list of basic medical services, excluding absurd shit like Suboxone, PREP, and Latuda for homeless retards, or get the fuck out of healthcare altogether and give those tax dollars back to the people.",

I think at a minimum we, as a nation, deserve a third Trump term to make up for the fact that his whole second term is gonna be wasted cleaning up the mess left by the unelected Biden junta.

Yes, I mean this unironically. \n\n>>519373907\n>you guys are traitors to the constitution\n\nIt's not your constitution, leaf, because we haven't annexed you yet.

The entire system is retarded, and it's been shown that medical costs have vastly increased in the last few decades. It's a monopoly. And so is the insurance industry.\n\nThe government could probably operate clinics and hospitals around the country to serve the people at less than they currently pay in all medical related benefits. Maybe doctors don't need to have mansions and 5 bentleys in the driveway. Maybe just a nice mercedes w\\ a custom plate to let everyone know you're better than them.\n\nBut the excess wealth is unnecessary and in general they need to fix cost rape at hospitals. If a hospital has 1000 beds, and only 100 are occupied, how could an overnight stay be valued at thousands of dollars? This entire model is retarded and predatory.",

Cut the insurance companies out of the loop entirely, and suddenly healthcare gets cheap enough that you can support universal healthcare on only slightly more taxpayer money than we are already paying to stay sick. The presence of welfare isn't the problem, the compromises that we have had to make to fit it in alongside for-profit industries is what have made it suck so much. Cut those industries, solve the problem.\n\n> abolish for-profit prisons. State and federal prisons can be used for actual criminals that really do need to be contained, which are a small fraction of who currently gets locked up in the US. Use the leftover prison real-estate as rehab centers designed to take in poor people/people with drug problems/mental health problems and give them the social work they need to have a real chance at getting back on their feet\nThere are always going to be some people you can't help, but for everyone one of those you have 3 people who end up in prison because they had nothing but bad options.
