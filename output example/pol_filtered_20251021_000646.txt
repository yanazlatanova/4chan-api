Do you even realize how fucking close the US is to an actual civil war? The government is currently shut down and while nobody fucking cares because those lazy bums don't do anything for the most part you're overlooking something even bigger. Food stamps are tied to this shut down. Thanksgiving is coming up for the burgers and millions of niggers won't have their free food. If there ever was an event that would start a fucking war it would be millions of niggers looting stores.

Holy shit. I hadn't realized this.
If the government doesn't start running again, I really do think it'll lead to mass lootings like you said.
This could be planned, as well. Thousands of blacks all looting stores collectively across the country. It will feed into the ever expanding racewar that has been being cultivated through events such as Iyrna's calculated murder.

It's over for my country.

I just realized why the American government seemingly bends over backwards for niggers. See a few of the more uppity niggers may think you can vote your way out of things, but the average nigger instinctively understands violence is the language that gets results. Maybe that's why they are being replaced by the Jeets as a slave class because the George Floyd riots reminded the Jews how crazy shit could get.

If you mean big food/ big agriculture /big pharmaceutical then you are correct.
The food stamp program is meant to go to the big corporations.
The poors are merely the middlemen to deliver them their corporate welfare funding from the government.
The government and big corporations literally make deals together, to do this.
It is not hyperbole.

If you have spent any significant amount of time among government workers at basically any level (that is, actually being in their workplace on a day-to-day basis, not just being in line at the post office or DMV), you would understand that the only thing that distinguishes those jobs from being a welfare recipient is the location of the chair you sit in all day.
Bare minimum function, zero critical thinking, zero accountability, zero responsibility.

>Not enough covert oversight?
No. Government intrinsically sucks at everything it does. Because the money it spends is printed rather than earned, there is no sense of ownership when decisions are made, and no real sense of loss when they turn out poorly.
Government exists to field an army and to execute macro-level infrastructure projects that no private entities reliably could (or world). Any time it engages in these endeavors, it's a given that it is going to suck at them, but there is no private alternative.

>also yes the ultra rich need to be taxed more 
No, they don't. Taxation is not a worthy solution to any problem in a fiat currency system.
What government needs to do is stop protecting them physically, legislatively, and financially. If you make a ton of money adding tangible value to society and being morally astute, you should be able to fart around in Aspen and Palm Beach and wherever.
If you've done it by seeking economic rents, engaging in graft/regulatory capture, clandestinely marketing products with adverse health effects to the public, then you're a fag and there's no reason the public shouldn't drag you out of your house and beat you to death on your front lawn.

The trick of the tail with governmental/legislative systems is to mitigate tension between natural accrual of resources/wealth that comes with healthy, productive society where free enterprise is possible and the desire of common people to vote in their own self-interest and to gradually erode an environment in which the former is possible.
Businesses own government nowadays. Everyone in Congress is on the payroll. Every single senate and congressional seat is occupied by a person whose job it is to lie to people in the respective districts/states and convince them that their individual personal needs are at the forefront while actually crafting laws that maximize free entry into and competition within markets.

Government used to be a referee. Now it's an intern.

Not wanting big agriculture, big food and big pharmaceutical to collect corporate gibs from the government, using the poors as the middleman to do it, does not make one a " liberal ".
It has been well known for decades that the government cuts back room deals with big agg, big food, and big pharm, to financially benefit from the food stamp program, while using the poors who are on the food stamp program, as the means to their ends.

The real criminals are the ones who hire illegals and give them a reason to come and stay, even if you deport every single one they’ll just keep coming as long as there are jobs to be had. Even the most brutal ICE raids are nothing compared to the cartels back home so it’s an easy calculation.

Everybody who hires illegals (including Traitor and Nigger Donald J Trump) needs to be punished. Everything else is just political theater and a waste of taxpayer dollars.

Ten trillion plus tip

Hiring illegals should be a federal offense punishable by minimum ten years in prison on the first offense, death on the second. Everybody who hires an illegal not only robs an American citizen of fair wages, they also force the taxpayer to subsidize their golems because they pay them so little and report none of it, making the spics eligible for infinity gibs.

Treasonous Nigger Donald J Trump and all his Treasonous billionaire friends who rely on spic labor must be tried and hanged for their Treason.

Yeah, people often get tired of hearing arguments they don't have a counter to.
You are the United States. The United States is you. It is the same body that made the decision to look the other way for the last 30 years while these people snuck in illegally and built productive lives (which by the way, if they can't demonstrate that they did, or worse if they were criminals, kick them the fuck out).
You did this. You made this decision when you felt it benefitted you, and now you want to change your mind with regard to some 8 digit number of people who've lived all around you for decades. You think you it's your prerogative to change you mind after 3 decades, regardless of cost to citizens and non-citizens alike? What are you, a woman? Are you mad at the illegals for something they did in a dream?

Let me ask you something else:
What have you heard lately about "securing our border"?
When was the last time anyone made a speech about that? To be honest, the last I recall hearing that issue get any significant press AT ALL is late 2020.
What efforts are being made to stop more from coming in? If you ask me, that's where 95% of the budget allocation for immigration control ought to go.

This specific iteration of government basically started its time in office by gutting administrative bloat in Federal offices, which I think we can agree is a good thing. Stripping government of some of its power and budgetary largess. Where did we promptly redistribute that? ICE raids. Literal masked gestapo shit by government agents on people living within US borders.
>IT'S NOT AGAINST AMERICAN CITIZENS
I don't think that matters much. This is just them normalizing the behavior. And with little publicized effort to secure US borders, I can't help but wonder if this is just more of the same old "let a problem fester so we can continue to spend skim off of the billions of dollars being spent pretending to solve it" federal government bullshit.

Fiona was a survivor on the panel advising the government’s grooming gang inquiry. She’s resigned this morning with the following reasons:

Two shortlisted chairs with backgrounds in policing and social work, the very institutions that orchestrated the cover-up

"Condescending and controlling language" used towards survivors who have fought for years to be believed

Survivors discovering they were never meant to be on the panel—they were supposed to be consulted separately

Panel members with alleged ties to the Labour government creating potential conflicts of interest

A senior inquiry appointee who has publicly contradicted the Casey Report's findings on grooming gangs

Repeated pressure from officials to expand the inquiry beyond group-based child sexual exploitation, diluting its focus

Survivors told their input mattered, then shut out of key meetings on a "first come first served" basis

A secretive process that has left survivors "panicked and suspicious of each other"

A second rape gang survivor has resigned from the panel, claiming that the National Inquiry wants to downplay racial and religious motivations behind their abuse. It looks like they’re trying to cover-up the Pakistani Muslim aspects of this yet again.

Zayum, that's crazy. I though American Citizens pay for tariffs. Or is it now the countries the tariffs have been placed on? And I guess turning away is when you're in constant meetings with Trump, new trade deals being drawn, new alliances being forged, new supply chains being created--all without China in the room. Even Pakistan has made new mineral deals and weapon purchases with the USA. PAKISTAN!ZAYUM. Tell me more, chinky

He can do things that do effect the market 

The Auto-pen guy killed all the cows because of COVID and started to mass import screw worm infected meat from Mexico and Brazil.

Trump stopped that (which is why prices skyrocketed) but it takes years for slaughterhouse beef to be raised unlike with chickens where it takes a couple of months.
Beef prices are going to be fucked until at least 2030. Dairy should always be dirt cheap because the sows are working overtime now. Dairy products (cheese, butter, etc) should be dirt cheap at the end of 2026.

Deregulation can be good and it can be bad. In this case, it is bad. 

Only simpletons see things in stark good-vs-bad, and specifically republican brand simpletons never fail to regurgitate the half-remembered lessons passed on by the movie star in chief Ronald Reagan, tongues sticking out waiting for the trickle down to start thirty years later. Regulation = always good is a peak brainlet position.

I must have missed when the handful of barely distinguishable neocons and neolibs that fluttered through the executive office over the last forty five years “tried socialism.” 

If you really want to frustrate a drooling overly nostalgic MIGA boomer, it’s good to remind them that the Cracker Barrel 50’s that they seem to long for was formed on the heels of FDR’s heavy regulations; it is arguably the most regulated time in America’s history. Labor unions were at peak power, Antitrust actually functioned, and the middle class saw meaningful gains and upward mobility. Deregulating allowed for aggressive lobbyism (70’s), the merging of insurance lenders and banks (90’s) and, as will later be evident, the single most influential Supreme Court case in America’s history: Citizens United. Now all of our politicians work for corporations/private equity/foreign interests because there are hardly regulations in place for “campaign” donations. Jimmy Carter had to his measly peanut farm to be president, and now Trump promotes his own crypto currency while in office, rug pulls his own supporters, and shills Teslas on the White House lawn. This is all without even getting into the bubbles that banks, who have proven time and time and time again, will generate and catastrophically pop when left to self-govern. 

Deregulation has absolutely fucked our politics. You seem like you’re pretty uneducated about this topic, so I’d encourage you to do some research.

Libertarianism is the only alternative.

If you don’t have a libertarian state, then it must be because you have some taxes, some regulations, or some government spending in the economy which is socialistic. It’s just a matter of how socialistic.

Ever since Bush Sr we were socialistic/communistic.

The reason the 1950s were so great was because we didn’t have Medicaid, Medicare, Americans with Disabilities Act, no Civil rights act, no LGBT.

Buisnesses could actually focus on business . Now if you’re rich the government takes all your money and gives it to poor people. Both parties focus on nothing but fucking over anyone who’s successful to give to blacks, migrants, transgenders, and drug addicted welfare addicts.

I reallly recommend you do some basic research because the fact that you don’t know this shows how uneducated people are. You don’t even know history.

Both republicans and democrats agreed that welfare and federal spending was necessary to help combat the struggles of soldiers, widowers, parentless children, the disabled, etc. The most cursory and lazy research can give you that information.

Without being a MAGAT, Libshitbro, Libtard, Anarchist, or Neonazi; What you're seeing is a result of a government that has been selling out Americans for years. 

If you look at history the more public utilities we sold and more private companies we bailed out the more corrupt things got. That's the whole reason you have PAC's and Lobbyist. 

Half of American's problems come from overpaid lobbyist, paid off politicians, and a well greased machine that rewards corruption. 

Trump is doing the same shit every other Admin has done except more aggressively and retarded like. 

I think what saves America is people waking up and actually demanding better use of their tax dollars. You're already seeing a lot more political involvement at local levels. The fed left or right will eventually have to take over things like water, healthcare, and manage tech/energy for the benefit of citizens to regain their trust. 

TLDR: States and Citizens are saying fuck the Fed, because they're tired of being cucked by foreign lobbying and federal money gibs

I truly hope we get a major reset. 

>inb4 nothing's gonna happen
Billionaires aren't buying up bunkers throughout the world if major shit won't go down. 

Anyone ever read Rainbow Six by Tom Clancy? It was written in 2000 and the plot was that a pharmaceuticals company and its eco-terrorist members created a global virus to kill off humanity. Meanwhile the CEO of the company, his wife (who was involved in the US government), and the inner circle of eco-terrorists had an impregnable compound built in Kansas so that they would be protected. Why did they want to kill humanity off? To save the planet and they can populate as the more environmentally-conscious people. 

Back then I thought this was the most hokey plotline ever. Ever since covid and the last 5 years, I realized that truth is stranger than fiction.

2019 was still normiecore world where you go into your office job and talk your workbuddies about the new episode of "Game of Thrones" that everyone watched the night before.
Then all of the muh pandemic and BLM riots and election bullshit in 2020. At least 3/4 of the population immediately went insane and wanted to murder you for not weaking triple masks or getting vaxxed. Never went back to the office. Noone really cares about normieslop TV shows anymore. Now realize that everyone else is either a fellow unironic Nazi barely even bothering to conceal their power level in public, or a batshit crazy no kings person who wants to kill you for not thinking Charlie Kirk was literally HitlerSatan.

I did this more or less in my 20s and it was the biggest mistake of my life. I was working in Washington at a small company and had a choice between working at a big investment bank in New York or at a government agency in small town Nowheresville.

Something these LARP posts fail to mention is that the local boomers will completely despise you. It doesn't matter if you voted for Trump or how based you think you are, they will always hate you because they didn't know your grandparents. They will use their contacts at the county and the local police department to find ways to fuck with you. They will put up their wigger kids to pick fights with you. They will make it their entire life's mission to run you out of town humiliated.

The majority of people in REPUBLICAN states vote to keep abortion legal. When people are asked yes or no should abortion be banned after 3 months with exceptions for rape health of mother etc most say it should be legal. 
A single yes or no question should it be legal to kill a healthy 3 month old child that was not conceived through rape and most people say it should be legal. Most men say it should be legal. Most whites say it should be legal. Most zoomers say it should be legal. 

And

Most people are against closing down a slaughterhouse. In a Democrat area 

**Denver, Colorado's Initiated Ordinance 309 (November 2024 Ballot)** was the voter initiative in question, aimed at banning slaughterhouses in the city. This measure sought to close Denver's last remaining slaughterhouse (Superior Farms in Globeville) by prohibiting their construction, maintenance, or operation starting January 1, 2026, while also mandating job support for affected workers.

### Exact Ballot Question
The precise wording that appeared on the ballot was: 
**“Shall the voters of the City and County of Denver adopt an ordinance prohibiting slaughterhouses, and, in connection, beginning January 1, 2026, prohibiting the construction, maintenance, or use of slaughterhouses within the City; and requiring the City to prioritize residents whose employment is affected by the ordinance in workforce training or employment assistance programs?”**

*(Voters ultimately rejected the measure, with about 58% voting "No.")*

>>519382822
### Verification of Claims

The 4chan post argues that "most people are evil" based on public support for abortion (framed as killing fetuses/children) and opposition to closing slaughterhouses (framed as supporting animal cruelty). I'll fact-check each specific claim below using recent 2024-2025 polls and election data. Overall, the claims are **mixed**: Broad support for abortion rights exists (especially among certain demographics), but nuance on gestational limits contradicts the post's framing of unrestricted late-term support. The slaughterhouse claim holds up. These views don't inherently prove "evil"—they reflect complex ethical trade-offs on bodily autonomy vs. fetal rights and economic/environmental concerns vs. animal welfare.

#### 1. **"The majority of people in REPUBLICAN states vote to keep abortion legal."**
 - **Partially true, but selective.** In the 2024 election, voters in **7 out of 10 states** with abortion-related ballot measures passed protections for abortion rights, including several Republican-leaning or red states like Missouri (where Amendment 3 passed 51.7% yes, enshrining abortion rights up to viability), Montana (57% yes), and Arizona (initially overturned by legislature but voter-supported). However, measures failed in other red states like Florida (55% no on Amendment 4), Nebraska (56% no on a restrictions measure, but it favored limits), and South Dakota (79% no on expansion). Nationally, this shows strong bipartisan support in some red areas, but not a uniform "majority" across all Republican states.

### 4. **"Most men say it should be legal. Most whites say it should be legal. Most zoomers say it should be legal."**
 - **True.** 
 - **Men**: 61% support legal abortion in all/most cases (Pew, Jun 2025).
 - **Whites**: Around 60-65% support (Pew breakdowns; e.g., non-Hispanic whites at 62% in 2024 PRRI data).
 - **Zoomers (Gen Z, born 1997-2012)**: 70-80% support legal access, higher than average (Forbes Aug 2024; Guardian May 2024 citing Pew shifts). Younger voters (18-29) were key in passing 2024 ballot measures.

#### 5. **"Most people are against closing down a slaughterhouse. In a Democrat area"**
 - **True.** As detailed in the post's quote (which matches verified data), Denver's Initiated Ordinance 309 failed with 58% voting "No" in November 2024. Denver is a strongly Democratic city (Biden won 80% in 2020; Harris ~75% in 2024). Voters prioritized jobs/economy over animal welfare in this blue stronghold.

In summary, while abortion support is robust (60%+ overall for legal in most cases), the post cherry-picks to ignore trimester limits and equates policy views with moral absolutes. Public opinion is nuanced—most favor early access but draw lines later. The "evil" label is subjective rhetoric, not fact.

You need 60% Yes votes to pass a constitutional amendment in Florida and the abortion one failed with like 56%. And that's after the state stole $10 million of Medicare money to shill to boomers to vote No on it. Find something else to complain about, we dindu nuffin.

### Step 1: Key Data for Scale
- **Abortions in the USA**: Recent estimates put the annual figure at about 1.1 million (ranging from 1.04 million to 1.14 million clinician-provided procedures in 2024). I'll use 1.1 million for calculations.
- **Factory-farmed animals**: Globally, around 90 billion land animals are raised and killed annually in factory farming systems (e.g., chickens, pigs, cows, turkeys), with the number rising yearly; this excludes trillions of fish/aquatic animals. (I'll focus on land animals as the core of "factory farms.") Suffering here includes both lifetime confinement/torture and slaughter.

These are orders of magnitude larger than your single instance: 1.1 million vs. 1 (abortion), and 90 billion vs. 1 (factory farming).

### Step 2: Framework for Units
To scale your base (40 rights units + 80 suffering units for theft-forced 2-hour labor redo), I define:
- **Rights units**: Severity of the core violation (e.g., property theft/liberty infringement). Your case is minor (economic/autonomy harm, no bodily integrity loss). I scale by moral weight: human life > animal life > property.
- **Suffering units**: Intensity × duration of inflicted pain/distress. Your case: moderate intensity (hated labor) × 2 hours = 80 units (40/hour base rate). I adjust for sentience, procedure/lifespan, and cruelty.

It's misleading. Nebraska voters actually approved two measures that were aimed at "protecting abortion". One was a misleadingly worded measure that actually put restrictions on abortion while sounding like it was making abortions "safer" (except also making them illegal when non-doctors decide they're unsafe). The other measure was pretty much what you'd expect when you hear mention of a measure that protects abortion rights, and wasn't misleading. They both passed, but the misleading one supercedes the honest one because of bureaucracy. Many people that thought they were voting for abortion rights didn't take the time to find out one of the measures was a scam, as too many "enlightened" voters all too often do.

I'm actually pretty passionate about this issue, which is internet shills. As many of us were totally unaware, the internet completely changed. Retards like these attended casting couch interviews to read scripts on the internet.

I would suspect that they engage in all means of manipulation including bots to manufacture an environment in which it looks like many people are donating them money which in turn actually does coax people into giving them money. Any one of these guys apart from the downsy asian who I don't recognize can go live on tiktok and get thousands of people in their streams, and basically print money. All while pushing approved democrat talking points.

These guys 100% violated election laws w\ this behavior and the way they coordinate is a form of monopoly : IE, your aunt goes on tiktok for political content, OH.. LOOK AT THESE POPULAR GUYS...

But they're literally just paid actors reading talking points and funneling traffic away from REAL people who are independently trying to do political content.

Andrew Tate made the point that Dean Withers is effectively a woman, in fact. I'm totally against digital id but there does need to be something done about these groups assembling people like this to stream on their behalf. Those people may as well be bots. The internet is for the people.

Literally fuck off w\ these paid shills.

If Trump sends Vance over to Israel then it’s proof that Trump finally trusts Vance and is giving him an actual responsibility. 

If Vance doesn’t go to Israel, or has to go with an escort like Witkoff or Rubio, then that means Trump still does not trust JD because of his lib far left history

That's good. Giving Takaichi an early foreign policy win would be good for strengthening her position in Japan, since her new coalition has such a slim margin to do anything. If I'm not mistaken, I think even with the new coalition she needs one more vote for a majority, which means the CPJ or Sanseito need to toss her one vote.

If only. They had a good draw on the three-judge panel (2 Trump appointees), but the rest of the 9th will bitch and try to do en-banc so they can say its heckin illegal again.

Prediction: Trump will push for immediate cert for SCOTUS if the 9th runs en banc, they will likely take it on the emergency docket, and they will likely allow deployment until it comes before SCOTUS fully. And then the salt miners will be busy.

Geography and the mandate of heaven dictate that America must and will bring Australia, Japan, and the UK into the fold. Along with Argentina, that gives us an FOB everywhere that we need one to maintain global hegemony, or at least the option to intervene decisively anywhere on earth. Viceroyalties. They need us more than we need them, but they can make themselves useful and (other than Argentina) have sentimental value to us, culturally. I think annexation of Canada and Greenland are also inevitable, even if it doesn't happen during Trump's presidency. America is going to become more overtly imperial because everyone is.

It's usually cell phone telemetry data compared to a normal baseline sample.

Playing unclear guessing games on crowd size isn't even the right MAGA response. The right response is to point out that crowd size here is just a measure of TDS for never-Trumpers, and to laugh at how fucking geriatric most of those protesters are.

Huh that's weird why is this image dated Jan 19, 2025 and there is no other image lecturing about the faggot that might be more recent-

> On November 22, 2024, President-elect Trump announced his nomination of Bessent for U.S. Treasury Secretary in the second Trump administration. Bessent was confirmed by the United States Senate on January 27, 2025, by a 68–29 vote, and sworn in as the 79th U.S. Treasury Secretary on January 28, 2025.

Ah of course, it was only trying to force the removal of the nomination

I am pleased to announce that ground has been broken on the White House grounds to build the new, big, beautiful White House Ballroom. Completely separate from the White House itself, the East Wing is being fully modernized as part of this process, and will be more beautiful than ever when it is complete! For more than 150 years, every President has dreamt about having a Ballroom at the White House to accommodate people for grand parties, State Visits, etc. I am honored to be the first President to finally get this much-needed project underway — with zero cost to the American Taxpayer! The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly. This Ballroom will be happily used for Generations to come! President DJT

It's truly incredible. They think the gibs just poof out of thin air, but only while the government isn't shut down. They don't make the connection that those are people's taxdollars.

Alas, I think I will use this unfortunate fact to do the unthinkable and (1) read some of these books, (2) consider non-book purchases, and (3) put a pause on collecting in order to save money. There's a nice German blu-ray set I want to get next month, plus that Trump merch I posted about recently, but other than that, I think quieter times may be upon me.
>>519396923
I'll get this, but I'll wait for the inevitable discount. No offense to Eric, but political books like his have such massive print runs that you can get it 50% off in a few months and still get a first printing copy.

Purge all who voted for either NDAA or Beijing Biden in 2021!

Remember that our Trump movement's roots are in the Tea Party.
Any Republican old enough to run for office will hold beliefs indicative of a Tea Party past.

Get involved! Initiate referenda! Write bills!
Become a pollwatcher, candidate, or staffer!
Vote in every election--federal, state, and local!
Pray a rosary and a chaplet of divine mercy every day!

Anything you can do to make America great again, do it!

We need an ALL-OF-GOVERNMENT response to the migration crisis in our Country!

State should be negotiating a deal with Russia for Russian migration agents to send illegals to gulags!
Treasury should be checking immigration status with tax filings!
Transportation should be collecting immigration status when they inspect trucks!
Interior should be prowling for illegals in our national parks!
Agriculture should be checking for immigration status when they do food safety inspections!
Labor should enforce CITIZEN-ONLY UNIONS!
JUSTICE should be launching an all-out judicial crackdown to crush migrant crime and anti-American discrimination! 
WAR should be mobilizing to clear illegal alien terrorists off the streets!
Commerce should be hunting down illegals on the high seas!
HHS should be cracking down on migrant labor in hospitals and clinics!
HUD should be rounding up illegals at apartment complexes and helping DHS to imprison illegals!
ED should be collecting data on illegals in our schools!
Energy should be kicking illegals out of power plants and tightening security protocols against migrant crime & terrorism!
VA should be helping other agencies to filter benefits and keep illegals out of public benefits!
Even other agencies of DHS can lend their staff to ICE and CBP! (In fact, why not send some BPAs to help ICE?)

Every department has multiple roles it can fulfill in our national struggle against the migration crisis! Labor can do a lot more than just break bad unions--they collect labor statistics, it's not hard to collect illegal alien labor data!

REGULATE EMPLOYER-SPONSORED IMMIGRATION TO DEATH! Have every department writing regulations to protect the American people against legal alien labor and ensure only the most vital aliens are allowed into America!

We cannot stop restricting the barbarians until our wages recover and our Country is happy and prosperous again!

As insane as it shows I feel like Canada will come back do to it's foundations even before confederation was a literal rejection of the enlightenment, so reactionary and religious we revolted against the American and French Revolutions. Reformations can be deadlier then revolutions and Trump might just be Globohomo's Pizza Hut commie. Events and spaces for non-zionist rightists to meet up and get together is growing. Canada maybe be terrible but it isn't North Korea yet. The UK and Germany has far more censorship.

Short answer : Jews
Long answer :The current money creation system, controlled by central banks, acts as a silent weapon against citizens of developped countries. By printing money without any real productive counterpart, the value of savings and wages is diluted. Prices are skyrocketing, while incomes are stagnating, condemning families to become poorer every year. Real estate prices are reaching unaffordable heights, preventing young people from finding housing, starting families and passing on their wealth. 
The middle classes are thus trapped: lifelong tenants, dependent on public assistance or forced into debt. 
>At the same time, the state justifies massive immigration to compensate for the demographic crisis it is perpetuating through this destructive economic policy.<
This mechanism, presented as technical and inevitable, is in reality a massive transfer of wealth from citizens to financial institutions and the wealthy. Behind technocratic words such as ‘quantitative easing’ lies a system that erodes peoples, weakens their sovereignty and compromises their future.

By giving women, 100 years ago, freedom to vote and freedom to choose their own husbands instead of their fathers doing so for them, men after a few decades eventually have become the military and economical slaves of women, carrying societies on their backs to create a sex playground for women to fuck 5% of the men (many of other countries and cultures nonetheless, with total different values than the society we want to build) , while all other single lonely men pay taxes and go to war, to live alone, childless, without legacy, like a slave.

No more

Where are the real men at, who with me will work towards putting a stop to this absolute matriarchal nonsense?

Every single working male must have children of his own, or society will erupt into chaos and violence.

That's because you are a retard. "tax the biollionaires" is literally women thinking, wanting to share more money made by men to improve their womanly sex playground.

Communism is a female ideology, the first communist governments appeared as soon as women were invited into politics and into choosing their own (simp, communist) husbands

In the past women were required to do their duty

Women freedom is only 100 years old. Stop being a disingenous liar, women were never a problem.

Either women would have to continue marrying and giving families to men, or if they wanted freedom, they should had been given their own plot of land and told to work it and defend it on their own

The only problem we've ever had from women, was telling them they could vote into our male built society, and they could choose to reproduce with us or not. As soon as we did that they gamed our system and turned it against us, and now we are their literal slaves

Then you would go duel the guy that fucked her and maim or kill that cunt in the middle of the street.
See, you think you're lamenting the "downfall of women in the modern era" or some fem-centric regurgitated dogshit like that, but what you're actually sad about, without even fucking consciously realizing it is that you've been raised by four subsequent generations of men who, because they were living fat and happy, tacitly and incrementally voted to strip themselves and their descendants of any semblance of the power and agency that makes a man a man in the natural world.

All South Korean men are forcefully conscripted into the military for like a year or two. So 99% of Korean men have military training and there is increasing resentment. It honestly wouldn't surprise me if things boil over and votes stop mattering.

not true

Even in the ancient Roman empire, there were literal written laws stating even divorced women had to marry again with X years

Every man got a woman because all women had to marry back then, there was a 1x1 ratio and hypergamy could never exist, because as soon as some men were without women they would form their own government to ensure they had women

There is a reason monogamy has been the rule for 5000 years: it's the literal pillar of civilization, without monogamy (or at least each men having children) civilization does not exist, and violence will erupt

That's magical thinking. A lie repeated is still a lie. Any honest person raises an eye brow over millions of people appearing for a single election cycle and then making an exit never to be seen again. There's a certain sort of person who discourages investigations of historical oddities like the holocaust and they're always the worst.

This but unironically 

Boomers are 25% to blame, Jews are 55% to blame, women are 20% to blame. Teachers are 15% to blame and government/parents (gen x) 26% are to blame. I say this as a woman. I’m 22 I’m a virgin and I honestly feel so bad for the men today. I obviously want to be a stay at home wife. Most men don’t understand this concept except you guys and you guys get pissed on for believing what is right. Society rellly sucks. I’m waiting a young man who’s economically independent but that’s so hard to find and I really don’t blame men at all.

There are indeed entrances scattered around the continent. From what I gather the majority are human DUMBs, though Alien controlled bases do exist too. Their population is much smaller than humans though and they're secretive. It's a bad idea to go looking for either.

I used to have a list of all known entrances in America and Canada but it was scrubbed. The eastern half of the continent has more entrances that would be accessible to the average person, out West they all mostly lead to military or government installations from what I remember so your chances of finding on are less likely. I know the list still exists somewhere on the internet but good luck finding it in 2025.

As far as contact, no point really. There's not much they can do for you that would change anything, you better have something special for them as agreements are already in place, and they don't include you.

Yes, we cannot confirm this with certainty due to information that the Americans have classified in order to avoid damaging the image of their Air Force, but from a technical point of view, the P-18 is more than capable of detecting “invisible” aircraft mathematically and mechanically thanks to its meter-range waves. This is one of the reasons why it is still in service around the world.

The US doctrine involves the targeted use of aviation in areas where US influence is needed. Of course, they are not intended for large-scale military operations against anything more formidable than rebels in flip-flops. All American military equipment is not designed for war with a powerful state, just like Russian and Chinese equipment. After a month or two of such a war, both sides will suffer huge losses in military equipment and manpower. Sticks and stones will come into play. Or nuclear weapons. This is why a war between two or more powerful nations would most likely spell the end of humanity. That is why all intelligent people in government positions fear it so much.

>Of course, they are not intended for large-scale military operations against anything more formidable than rebels in flip-flops
Do not underestimate flip-flops people. Europeans have their limits. Russians can be pushed a lot before breaking, but you break too. 
They are something else, they are willing to eat dust, live in caves for decades and commit to fighting until they don't have to, use any methods possible. Mostly because they're uncivilised and low IQ, however that doesn't make them less dangerous fighters.
I think Americans have gotten quite good at defeating shitholes like these, however they failed in nation-building. But rotten countries (nothing personal, modern governments in general are rotten including mine) cannot nation-build.

If you compare how USSR fared in Afghanistan and how Americans fared it's actually like looking at the opposites: USSR took a lot of military casaulties and equipment losses, however nation-building was more successful, while US took minimal casaulties, used the natives more and took most of the Afghanistan but failed to build up a proper government.

Humans are naturally egoistical, victimising and crooked to some degree so don't think anyone is higher than you especially the enemies you defeated, I'm no more noble than an average American. Libshits in the west (and even the east) need to get it through their heads. I find worship of defeat and struggle (native Americans, blacks, etc, Slavs) disgusting as it impedes progress and hurts real national pride.

>Following admission by the White House that Powers had been captured alive, American media depicted Powers as an all-American pilot hero, who never smoked or touched alcohol. In fact, Powers smoked and drank socially. The CIA urged that his wife Barbara be given sedatives before speaking to the press and gave her talking points that she repeated to the press to portray her as a devoted wife. Her broken leg, according to the CIA disinformation, was the result of a water-skiing accident, when in fact it happened after she had had too much to drink and was dancing with another man.
>In the course of his trial for espionage in the Soviet Union, Powers confessed to the charges against him and apologized for violating Soviet airspace to spy on the Soviets. In the wake of his apology, American media often depicted Powers as a coward and even as a symptom of the decay of the United States' "moral character."

I did it for the meme, but I find it fascinating myself. Watch any Bush interview in recent years and look at the comments. “WOW this is what REAL class from a president looks like. I didn’t like him at the time, but I’d take him over what we have now”

Yet at the time they were calling him everything they call Trump now. Makes me think that one day a future president will make lefties wish for the orange man back.

Don't worry, they'll do exactly the same with the next not-Trump GOP presidential nominee (especially if he wins the White House.)

Bush was called every name under the sun back in like 2006. Warmonger, Nazi, Hitler, genocide, war criminal, you fucking name it. Now they're like "oh, he wasn't that bad, Trump's the real monster."

The cycle will continue. You saw examples of it already in 2022 when they thought Ron DeSantis was going to be the next nominee, there were articles about how he was "worse than Trump." They'll be calling the new guy the real villain and Trump "not that bad" as soon as January 21, 2029 rolls around if Dems lose in 2028.

They were greatly aided by FDR.
>and FDR’s policies were not the economic boom
Yes they were. His investment in infrastructure and jobs dedicated to infrastructure, like the TVA, made the entire economy more productive and interconnected, the 8 hour work day, Social Security and abolition of child labor created the concept of the modern middle and working classes. 
>being the only unaffected industrial giant made the boom
Which is also thanks to FDR not getting America dragged into the war any earlier.
>Democrats have had power the majority of my life and wealth inequality has skyrocketed
The primary cause is this is GOP tax cuts and deregulation.

in China!

https://fortune.com/2025/10/19/jensen-huang-nvidia-china-market-share-ai-chips-trump-trade-war/

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says his company has lost all access to China's market after U.S. export restrictions eliminated what was once a 95% share. Speaking in an interview with Citadel Securities, Huang questioned the wisdom of policies that cost America one of the world's largest markets. The Biden Administration imposed rules in 2022 to restrict exports of Nvidia's most advanced AI chips to China. The Trump Administration blocked additional chip sales in April and later granted export licenses for certain Nvidia and AMD chips in exchange for 15% of revenues. Chinese regulators responded by telling domestic tech companies to avoid Nvidia chips designed to meet U.S. export requirements. Beijing also placed strict limits on exports of rare earths. Huang noted that about half the world's AI researchers are in China and called it a mistake not to have them build AI on American technology.

It goes beyond this. According to Nick Land who had published information about Epstein's island, or at least the concept of it, back in the 90s, the basic occult zeitgeist of the modern elite is this:
Human souls are the DNA of the personality active beyond the body, but they can be affected by the body as well since it's like the Tao in that it's inseparable and separation comes from our perception through ignorance. Because of this, the soul can be influenced through genetics and DNA altering. Ancient elites would permeate their souls through society and achieve "illumination" which is having yourself become a thoughtform. This is very very oversimplified but the semantics are unnecessary here, but this thoughtform is fueled and carried through ambient human belief. 
Jesus was not the son of God UNTIL enough people believed it, and then when he died his soul transmuted into this higher thoughtform which retroactively made it true. 
Because this is how elites see it, they believe in Jesus but in a different way that a serf may believe in Jesus. This is why dead presidents have so much memorabilia, this is why seemingly inconsequential pieces of information and history are pushed to the public, this is why a lot of things. Modern entertainment was made with this specifically in mind, to immortalize more and more people; to "immanentize the eschaton"

I'll have to read about Nick Land. Anton LaVey wrote about achieving immortality through causing a psychic imprint in the material world in a similar way to the Presidential memorabilia you mention. As an aside, I think Obama tapped into Lincoln's egregore during his rise with his contrived midwest speaking cadence and a few major movies about Lincoln during his tenure. If we go with the DNA vaxxine scenario, it sounds like horcruxing from Harry Potter on a mass scale. "immanentize the eschaton" - I now if read that term before but don't remember where.

In all honesty if the government ran universal medicaid it would be bankrupted and ineffectual within a couple years. Medicare and Medicaid fraud has everything to do with propping up a profoundly retarded insurance system. Both insurance and medicaid are an Ouroboros that feeds itself. Cut one of them out and the other will die. 

We would be better off if the healthcare entitlements rug were pulled and hospitals were forced to adjust their prices to what people can afford. Yes, poor people would get fucked, but right now the alternative is poor people who don't contribute to society get free medical care and the rest of us who have actual value to society are the ones getting fucked. 

The government either needs to restrict medicaid to a finite list of basic medical services, excluding absurd shit like Suboxone, PREP, and Latuda for homeless retards, or get the fuck out of healthcare altogether and give those tax dollars back to the people.

Norway has a population of like 5.5 million people. Your entire "nation" would be in 10th place on a list of most populous US metropolitan areas. While we're on that note, I do find it curious that none of these liberal democrat cities are willing to implement free healthcare within their own cities. They could very easily vote such policies in on their own local levels if they truly cared.

>Medicaid 
Hospitals in California are telling Medical(California's Medicaid) to fuck off. They won't take it because the prices Medical demands are too low. This is why LA has such a low ratio of hospital beds and hospital beds to people. Hospitals literally cannot function with all these spics dropping out crotch goblins and using the ER like clinics on government dime. 

Right before the election I visited my father in law at the ICU at the USC hospital, and walked through the ER. Literally everyone there was a "no hablas Ingles" spic who did not have an emergency. Spics know that the ER can't refuse them and that Medical will pick up the bill. Illegals get free healthcare.

Here's the thing. People DO have a choice, the problem with subsidizing healthcare is that it makes people offload their well-being to the government. What is the point of staying thin and fit when you know the government will pay for your diabetes treatment when you eventually become a wheelchair bound slob? Why have kids in your 20s and not in your 40s when risk is much greater when you know the government will pay for your retarded child? The incentive structure is broken.

I'm old. Old enough to have been around since the beginning of the shitstorm called the internet. I've never uploaded a picture of anything, ever. Why? Because even back then, we had enough common sense to know if the government is allowing you to have something, and even encouraging it, you should not fucking trust it.

I don't order shit online, have a credit card/score, or have any social media. I've never had my identity stolen or shit like that because, well, who the fuck am I?

Pay in cash, try not to sign anything, and always carry a gun. People are bad and the worst people are the most powerful. There, some fathering for you sorry sacks of shit.

I do not have social media. My family is obsessed with Facebook. I cannot do anything with them without somebody pulling out their fucking phone to snap pictures. I hate it. I have told them several times please no pictures. They seem to think it’s funny. I am, seriously, considering no longer meeting with them. It seems a petty reason to avoid family but I think it’s also pretty fucking petty that they INSIST on constant photographs. I tried visiting my local Republicans club and same fucking thing with the constant photos, so I never went back. Boomers are really horrible with their phones.

I made a Facebook account near high school graduation just to coordinate some things around that time. I continued using it for a couple of years after but other than that have never really bothered with social media. I don't know why not constantly telegraphing your daily life means you have some kind of issue. Is it just because it makes it harder for the government to track you?

My Liberty of bodily autonomy, to be the final God of gods and lord of hosts in regards to what Government amplifying, corrective or restorative medicines go into my body, was yanked away from me the moment I needed it most and I gave up a career to be king of that hill.

Now the Jews refuse to let anyone remember the Tyranny of what they did, and the harms they brought to everyone while forcing their jewish Tyranny on every American citizen. 

The Jews came within inches of killing people in broad daylight to make an example of the people would not take the Government forced medicine, and at least 20 million people had to give up their rights to be employed by Jewish Satan, to stand on those principles.

As far as I'm concerned the USA is finished, and improved behavior is not going to change this designation. The United States of America is gone, I am living under an occupation of people who are not affiliated with the light on a hill that the founding fathers created. 

We are now a Jewish Kingdom. And I am in captivity to this Kingdom.

The reason government initioatives often fail is because as soon as they d=stary working, Republicans cut finding for them so they can fuck them up on purpose so they can say "look, it's not working!" which then allows them to advocate for privitization. They've been doing this for decades - Obamacare is a good example.

It's not. It's the developer...or the company that builds the neighborhoods


Some cities do sidewalks but it's incredibly rare. Most neighboorhood and amenities are completely the responsibility of the developer

My neighborhood was built by Lennar. It has sidewalks after we voted to add them...we paid a one time assessment of $39 a month for a year. But the neighborhood next to it does not. But the city has an old sidewalk that connects to my neighborhood but it's uneven like picrel

He's a builder because he's paid to do a job.
He is forced, by government regulations, to only do what he is allowed to do.
He often times has no say in it.

To give a stupid example, if he's building a brick wall and the city decides ALL BRICK MUST BE BLUE, the wall will be half red original and half blue new. He has no choice in how it's done.
>>519389744
>slightly lowering his bottom line
If he was to pull up the previous sidewalk, there would be people who would argue "WOW WHY DIDN'T YOU DO ALL THE OTHER SIDEWALKS IN THE ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD SO THEY WOULD ALL MATCH?!"
It's beyond not worth it. Doing work for people individually is one thing, doing work for the city is another.

or
>the video of him shitting on people protesting (i.e. protesting the current power) and this video now is a signal to ALL subjects (everyone who isnt part of the club) that goes ''nothing you do will help you we dont give a shit if you protest and will rule forever''
I dont know why but the second answer is more plausible because of the plausible deniability and that they tell you what they plan in advance.

If Obama was able to keep running Trump would be literally nothing but some fat boomer reality star that failed at a presidential run. 

Ap my question, did Obama become potus more than twice?

You’re a Poo. So you seethe about Trump. 
Although yes we need rid of judaism. And numbered Bibles and abstractionist churches who have used them. 
Bonfires. We just need bonfires, they are not high tech just look at Britain on 5th November and you’ll see hundreds of thousands of them with a stuffed Catholic (effigy) sat on top of every one. That’s all it takes. 
Migrants too. Politicians. Media whores. ‘Elites’.
The world will heal. But like an infection needs burning out from a wound we need bonfires to burn the infection out of the world.

Ideology? 
Do you even know what that word means? 

Republicans set the tone for covid relief funding btw. And yes the new deal was a good policy, and it was popular, and helped people build families, and find work, and built infrastructure, and brought forth environment protections, and put runaway capitalism on rails. 

Before ww1 the US was constantly in rolling poverty death cycles and rich fags just monopolized everything. How many times did jp Morgan bail out the entire country?

Covid relief was also popular. Thus by your logic, the republicans did good by it. 

You are operating on state ideology of America when you don’t even live here. You think it’s alright for FDR to act like a king because of stories told to you as a child. 

Reality is, his new deal did very little to help the country. Most of the funds ended up in urban districts, so it effectively functioned as a pay out to his supporters. This was NOT good for America because this is where this dumb ass partisan politics comes from. 
The economic issues weren’t solved until the wars started.

Screaming and fear tactics are all they have because leftism/liberalism is peak feminine energy ideology. They do this because all women do is cry out for protection, and that's what Dems are doing; crying out to the voters hoping the voters will come save the day. What they don't get is that this crying is what drove them away in the first place. People are sick of dysfunctional nigger government.

No I don't view him as a king. I view him as a president during difficult circumstances. At least he held elections. 
It did very little? 
So the depression, ww1, spanish flu,, ww2 didn't have a massive economic impact on the nation to call for federal intervention? 

And yes, covid relief was a good thing. You're binary brain can't even function right now. I'm not agaisnt good policy, doesn't matter who put it forward.

But you accuse Trump of wanting to be a king for doing a fraction of what FDR did. 

This is what I mean when I say you’re brainwashed by ideology. FDR is in your team so he is double plus good. 
Trump is not on your team so he is double plus bad. 

You’re not capable of objectivity. This is why your message isn’t reaching people.

the only way Trump runs for a "3rd term" is if he succeeds in destroying the corporations of the united states and along with it, the bylaws called "The Constitution of the United States" (they just omit "Corporations" at the end) and reinstating the 1787 original, The Constitution For These United States of America, of which there were only ever 13 amendments max.
all the other amendments are made to the corporate bylaws and become null and void once the corporations and their bylaws are tossed in the trash

Don't care. Simple fact is that Trump has done more for ethnic European hegemony in this country than any president has in the last 70 years. Does he like jews way too much? Yeah and that shit sucks but the alternative is importing billions of brown subhuman jeets, spics and spooks so I'll compromise because there is literally no other choice.

I know but Harris would not be deporting anyone and we all know it. The most important thing is the destruction of birthright citizenship and ending egalitarian ideals, which he is doing. Jews will, regrettably, have to wait

Trump has been pushing his anti-Constitutional agenda hard since the start of his second term so the idea he'll chicken out and just allow himself to spend the rest of his life post-Presidency being dragged through the courts is ridiculous. Obviously he's constantly talking about never leaving office for a reason, he knows what will happen if he ever gives up being President again. The "TACO" meme is funny for the seethe it generates but way too optimistic.

He has chickened out on tariffs though, but that doesn't mean he'll chicken out on never leaving the Presidency willingly. Trump chickens out time to time but that doesn't mean he "always" chickens out. That's where the meme is wrong.

Trump just said his tariffs on China aren't sustainable and he's walking them back. That doesn't have anything to do with him being serious about never leaving office. You're trying to conflate his tariff agenda with his executive branch overreach and those aren't the same thing.

Anon you haven’t given any reason or evidence to believe that his walking back on tariffs isn’t characteristic of how he will leave office. 

What makes you think he won’t leave office? You’re trying to argue that Trump is incompetent but is also a threat to the nation. Make it make sense.

Other than health, there's personally no good reason for him to get out, what else is he gonna do. He has been super rich all his life, there's nothing particular he is looking for in retirement and it'd just be dealing with shit ton of legal cases after he loses power anyway. My guess is that he'll start some war that affects the country significantly and 'delay' election indefinitely for war/'insurrection' risks reasons. Hopefully he won't fuck with Russia or China too much and instead go for a more fun Greenland/Canada/Germany tier invasion.

What I don't get about today's "left" is that they're quick to call Donald Trump fans bootlickers, but they themselves are happy to side with warmongers for superficial/strategic political reasons and they side with huge corporations and intelligence cut-outs (NGO's) when they think corporations care about climate or diversity. The boutique left cannot see beyond the superficial marketing that has appropriated leftist esthetics for the sake of swindling them

Am I missing something? I maybe a fucking leaf, so by no means an expert on American law. But isn't there a two term limit?
I know that for a long while, it wasn't a law but ceremonial. but was eventually made into law.
Am I mistaken?
If I understand all that correctly, then why the hell are people bitching about Trump getting another term? Are they just that fucking stupid?

And when his 2nd term is over and he decides to stay in power what are the Democrats going to do?
He'll probably just declare the Democrats a terrorist organization and have them all arrested for treason.

Seconded. I think at a minimum we, as a nation, deserve a third Trump term to make up for the fact that his whole second term is gonna be wasted cleaning up the mess left by the unelected Biden junta. I'm willing to give Vance 8 years but then it's time for Barron aka the Kwizatz Haderach, to assume the throne. Yes, I mean this unironically.

It's not your constitution, leaf, because we haven't annexed you yet. I think we will begin incorporating secessionist provinces as U.S. territories by the end of 2026 though, beginning with Alberta.

Cyprus was openly pro russian even in the cold war era. So much so that the anglokikes and the kikes orchestrated the whole second more stupid greek junta and the even more stupid "democratic" globohomo μεταπολίτευση and the attila invasion of the roaches. The russians both of ussr and of putin, had done little to none thing to support the orthodox population of the island, just like they did with nakrobo karabah (however the fuck you pronounce it) proving themselves either too paper tiger like or too indifferent. Meanwhile they adore going to cyprus alongside with anglokikes both for nigger tier tourism and of course, economic shenanigans. Generally cyprus is the ireland of eastern and central europe in the whole cleaning money/passport visas/offices for foring companies to avoid taxes.

China has awful , catastrophic birth rates which will crater their supply chain optimization, but at least they aren't burdened by democracy. They will probably just shoot all the boomers is they start asking for benefits.

This is demanding that equity gets taxed twice for the same thing. Thats dumb as shit. Either set the tax rate at what you want it to be and tax once or stop being a fucking retard

Yes lets reduce the value of American labour and education. This is downs syndrome level retarded in the long run and pretty fucking stupid in the short term

well, as is, we are currently giving it away for free to a chunk of the population while making taxpayers and working people foot the bill. The entire system is retarded, and it's been shown that medical costs have vastly increased in the last few decades. It's a monopoly. And so is the insurance industry.

The government could probably operate clinics and hospitals around the country to serve the people at less than they currently pay in all medical related benefits. Maybe doctors don't need to have mansions and 5 bentleys in the driveway. Maybe just a nice mercedes w\ a custom plate to let everyone know you're better than them.

But the excess wealth is unnecessary and in general they need to fix cost rape at hospitals. If a hospital has 1000 beds, and only 100 are occupied, how could an overnight stay be valued at thousands of dollars? This entire model is retarded and predatory.

The issue with giving government power is they will fundamentally abuse that power. Look at those who are calling themselves the "Left".

Here is what you do instead:

> the tax cuts on corporations and the wealthy/carried interest loophole closure
Good start

> enforce anti-trust laws to break up large corporations.
Megacorps buying up and scrapping any competition that threatens them to protect their own profits makes our economy weak and reduces jobs, because instead of having 100 companies in an industry we have 3 that don't even need to provide good service because there is no other option anyway

> Private insurance is a scam, kill it
Medical care is as expensive as it is because health insurance companies make it expensive to inflate their own profits. Cut the insurance companies out of the loop entirely, and suddenly healthcare gets cheap enough that you can support universal healthcare on only slightly more taxpayer money than we are already paying to stay sick. The presence of welfare isn't the problem, the compromises that we have had to make to fit it in alongside for-profit industries is what have made it suck so much. Cut those industries, solve the problem.

> abolish for-profit prisons. State and federal prisons can be used for actual criminals that really do need to be contained, which are a small fraction of who currently gets locked up in the US. Use the leftover prison real-estate as rehab centers designed to take in poor people/people with drug problems/mental health problems and give them the social work they need to have a real chance at getting back on their feet
There are always going to be some people you can't help, but for everyone one of those you have 3 people who end up in prison because they had nothing but bad options. Whats a guy living out of his car with no money for food supposed to do except turn to crime to survive? You can't expect people to just commit suicide for your convenience. 

> reform campaign laws to get special interest money, corporations and foriegn advocates out of our elections
Simple as. The people we vote for need to work for US.
